Thanks for downloading! These beats are completely free to use and include audio/MIDI files.The MIDI note lengths might not be perfect for some beats, so please make sure theyÕre landing on the 1Õs when looping. Also the "UP" in some of the filenames was just my way of noting which files I've uploaded to my soundcloud.If you have any suggestions or questions, please leave me any feedback you like. IÕll be selling the next beat pack for $9.99, but any donations for this one are welcome! My bitcoin address is:1FvhnHngjV8CPa97wwM4iqvfLo4xLGR2cbMy PayPal address is alan.borecki@gmail.com (thatÕs also where you can email me for feedback, as well as my Drum Jockey page on facebook, youtube, or soundcloud).I love this scene and really hope these help you out! Cheers,Alan.www.facebook.com/thedrumjockeywww.youtube.com/user/thedrumjockeywww.soundcloud.com/drumjockey

Tips & Tricks for Beginners:

-For the fills folder, use them as the last four bars in a measure to introduce a new beat, a breakdown or to take a quick break from your main beat.

-Find parts of beats you like and combine them with others for your own unique version.

-If the kicks or snares sound too complicated on some beats and you want to tone them down, try removing the offbeats (usually on 1 and 3, sometimes's on the "e's"- and the "ah's", as in 1-e-&-ah in your count. If this isn't making sense to you, then look up rhythm theory and you'll be on your way to learning). 

-On a similar point, if a beat sounds too "fast", removing the 8th or 16th notes of the hihats should do the trick.

-Change the filenames of the beats you like so you can find them faster.

-Move shit around, try and break it. Sometimes you'll accidentally come up with a wicked pattern. It helps to move by layer (kick, snares, toms, hats) over a few beats. If you really want to experiment, turn quantization off or set it to something really high (96 or 128) and alter some of the notes by a bit. 

-If you're looking for a quick and dirty way to build a standard dnb song, a good formula to start with is basic beat for 16/32 bars -> buildup (on the last 4/8/16 bars of your basic beat) ->  any beat for 16/32 bars -> any other beat for 16/32 bars -> back to basic beat.

-Changing pitches to your snares, especially the breakbeats, can yield some interesting results. I'll include some in a future pack release.

-Watch/read/listen to as much as you can about every aspect of producing. Fucking around in your DAW is a lot of fun, but knowing what everything does and why is what separates the ranks. Join forums and ask questions, keep up to date with the software/hardware and think of unique ways you can incorporate them. 

-Learning to play an instrument besides the decks will help a ton with your rhythm, melody and general arrangement. 

-Most producers use a synthesizer to help them work, but realistically, you can use any electric instrument as a sampler one way or another.

-Learn to market yourself online (and off). You do this because you love it, but getting paid for it is much better. Online marketing is my day job, so if there's enough interest, I'll write an ebook or something.
