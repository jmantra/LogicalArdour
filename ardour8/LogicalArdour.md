**What is LogicalArdour?**

LogicalArdour is an effort to bring GarageBand-like functionality and features to Ardour and Linux out of the box. It is mainly aimed at those who are new to music production and possibly new to Linux. GarageBand is a really fun tool to play with, but it is only available on Apple devices. This project was born out of wanting to bring that experience to Linux.

The name "LogicalArdour" comes from the fact that GarageBand is basically a stripped version of Logic Pro. The project in its current form also contains a couple features found in Logic Pro such as the Session Player (Chord progressions with an arpeggiator and MIDI strum plugin ) and Drum sequencing. I plan on adding more features as time goes on.

While this bundle mainly targets beginners, more advanced users may find some of the scripts and tools found in this project helpful. It uses Ardourâ€™s Lua scripting interface that work alongside various third party FOSS plugins, track templates, Python and Shell scripting.

**Goals/Features**

So you may be asking yourself, "What specific features from GarageBand are you targetting?" Below are the goals of LogicalArdour:

1. Guided menu system for creating different track types as well as changing Instruments/Plugins and presets. This is accomplished using the dialog menu features found in Ardour's lua scripting interface.
