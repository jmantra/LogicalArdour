Welcome to my Midi Drumloop Pack. I hope you have fun with the Midi Loops! :)

I made all of the Midi files myself and you have the right to use them however you want in you Beats, Songs, Films etc.
However I do not allow you to sell them (the Midi files, of course you can sell the beats you make with them).
If you want to give the Midi Pack or files from it to someone else, please make it clear that they are from me.
Ideally just give them the Link to the Youtube video https://youtu.be/J8JGu28fgcs

Mentioning me when publishing stuff you made with this pack is NOT necessary, however if you do I'd appreciate it a lot.

If you have any wishes for sample packs or other things, please leave a comment on my youtube channel and I might do it in the future :)
Also make sure to leave a sub, there are a lot more samples packs coming soon! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzkRDhQ3PH7E3wJQcWCBzjw
