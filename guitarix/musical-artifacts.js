Vox built the transistor preamp loaded 730 amp in 1965, and late in 1966 the very similar all-transistor Conqueror. Both were used by the Beatles.\nThe GxVmk2 emulates the preamp stage of the Vox Conqueror amp, and is here used to emulate some classic guitar tone from 1966, 1967 and 1968.\nAs the presets are voiced as an effects frontend for a real amp, you will have to add at least a cab emulation in series - either a 2x12 or 4x12.
